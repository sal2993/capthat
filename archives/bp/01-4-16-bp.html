      <h1 class="tpost_title">Create a user for your Droplet</h1>

      <p class="tpost_body">Before you go on to create your awesome web app or 
      any thing else your mind desires, you must first get rid of a bad habit 
      of logging in as root user. When you spin up a new droplet, you start
      as being root user. Being a root user can be convenient but it 
      is widely accepted as a bad practise. This is because it is a security 
      hazzard to constently use the root user. To circumvent this, we must
      create a new user with sudo privliges.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating a user</h3>
      <p>Since you most likely just started a new droplet, chances are that
      you are most likely root user. To create a new user (as root) you type
      the following to the command line:
      </p>
      <p class="red">adduser [insert user name you want here]
      </p>
      <p>You will then be asked the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To choose a password (choose a good one)</li>
        <li>To Enter other user information (ie. name, phone, address). If you
        don't need this information you can just hit the 'ENTER' key and leave
        it blank</li>
        <li>Then it will ask you to confirm this information so you can 'Y' to
        continue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You now have a new user!! Next we will give that user the proper sudo
      privleges and keys so you will be able to log in to that user using ssh.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to try your new user account type, "su [username you chose]"
      and it will prompt you for the password you chose. To go back to the root 
      user (which we will need to proceed) just type, "exit" in the command line.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Giving the user Sudo privleges</h3>
      <p>Next you will need to give the new user sudo privileges so you can get
      some real work done.</p>
      <p>We do this by using visudo. While on root user, type this to the command line:</p>
      <p class='red'>visudo</p>
      <p> Then search for the line that reads, </p>
      <pre># User privilege specification
      root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      </pre>
      <p>Copy this line and paste it right below (copy for me is
      CTRL-SHIFT-C, and past is CTRL-SHIFT-V) or type it word for word.
      On the new line you just pasted, change only the 'root' to your new user
      you created which will look like this:
      </p>
      <pre>root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
newuser    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      </pre>
      <p>Next you must save the file by hitting the keys [CTRL-X], followed by
      typing 'Y', and hit [ENTER] to confirm.
      </p>
      <p>Now the new user will have administrative privileges. To use these
      privileges you must type 'sudo' before typing administrative commands.
      For example: 
      </p>
      <p class='red'>sudo [command you want]</p>
      <p>To add new users, follow the same steps.</p>

      <h3>Giving the new User SSH Keys</h3>
      <p>In order to log in to your new user with SSH, you will have to give
      the new user the proper public keys. To do that you will have to exit the
      droplet back to your computer. Type this to the command line till you are
      back in your local computers terminal:</p>
      <p class='red'>exit</p>
      <p>To give your new user the proper keys, type this to the command line:
      </p>
      
      <p class="red">
      ssh-copy-id [your username]@[your ip address]
      </p>
      <p>Example: 'ssh-copy-id cooluser@123.45.67.89'
      </p>
      <p>Now if it is your first time logging in. It will prompt you to type
      'yes', so go ahead and do that. It may also ask you for your password,
      so type the password you set up for this user.
      <p>You should be able now to log in as this user through ssh. It may ask
      you for your password but in the next tip we will change this so we can 
      only log in with the keys (more secure).

      <h1 class="tpost_title">Change SSH config</h1>

      <p class="tpost_body">The first thing that is suggested when you create a
      new droplet is to change the ssh config page. In this post I will not be
      teaching how to set up ssh keys, for that you should follow this page
      <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets'
      target="__blank">How to set up ssh keys</a>, but for those of
      you who already have your keys set up and ready to go, Here is the two
      things you should change to your ssh config file.
      </p>

      <h3>Disable Root Access and Enable Keys Access Only</h3>
      <p>First you must edit the ssh config file by changing to the ssh 
      directory so type the next time to the command prompt:</p>
      <p class="red">cd /etc/ssh/</p>
      <p> Then you must open up your favorite text editor (I use vim)</p>
      <p class="red">sudo vim sshd_config</p>
      <p>[[<strong>WARNING</strong>]] Before you do this step <b>MAKE SURE</b>
      that you have already
      completed tip one so you do not lock yourself out of your droplet.
      </p>
      <p> Next, find the line that shows "PermitRootLogin yes" and change it to
      "PermitRootLogin no"
      </p>
      <p> Also find the line that says, "#PasswordAuthentication yes" notice it 
      will be commented with a # therefore it will be a different color, then
      change the line to, "PasswordAuthentication no". Notice I removed the #.
      </p>
      <p> after you will need to restart SSH. There are a few ways to do this.
      One way is to type:
      </p>
      <p class="red">sudo reboot ssh</p>
      <p>Another is to type:</p>
      <p class="red">ps aux | grep ssh</p>
      <p>This will bring up a list that looks like this,
      </p>
      <pre>"root    579  0.0  1.0  55164  5388 ?      Ss    2015   5:1   6 /usr/sbin/sshd -D"
      </pre>
      and a few other ones similar to it. Find the one that ends with 
      "/usr/sbin/sshd -D" and get the PID which in my case is 579. 
      Then type with YOUR PID:
      </p>
      <p class="red">sudo kill -HUP 579
      </p>
      <p> This will restart ssh and you are all set</p>

      <p> Doing these tips will make sure that your droplet is more secure.
      Taking away the root access and only allowing key access with reduce the 
      brute force attempts at breaking into your droplet.
